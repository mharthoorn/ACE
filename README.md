# ACE
ACE. An Abstract Compiler Engine with which you can define a language with little overhead. 

*My father always says: if you want to learn a language build a compiler in it.*

### Language defininitions
You can define a language in code in a BNF'ish format. 
It works with full look ahead. So it's not the fastest compiler. But it allows for unlimited languages complexity.

### Components
It has a lexer, parser, AST, a .NET binary producer and a .NET type checking system for expression parsing. 

### Builder
It has a basic system to build binaries.

### Example language
An language project "Moksi" is included as example.
